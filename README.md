# Chinabot
A satirical parody of the Chinese government

**Chinese Embassy -  Documentation**

_/chinatime_
The reason why this bot was created in the first place. This command will return the current time in mainland China.

_/flipacoin_
This command will simply flip a coin for you and display it in an embedded message for you to view.

_/lightshot_
Will generate a random URL from prnt.sc/ for you to view. There is a chance that the image might be deleted, if that is the case, just try again!

_/ssl_
This is game of Stein Saks Laks! The rules of this game are:\nStein beats Saks and Laks. Saks beats Laks but loses to Stein. Laks loses to Stein and Laks. If both pick the same, it's a tie. Will you risk playing Saks?

_/plot {function}_
The plot command is probably the most useful command added to this god forsaken bot. To put it simply, run /plot followed by the function you wish to plot. For example: /plot x^3 That's it! It is important to separate x variables with a * or else it will not run. E.g 2*x and not 2x.

_/reddit {subreddit}_ 
This command will return a random image from a subreddit of your choosing.

_/weather {city}_
As obvious as this is, I'll still explain it. You run /weather and give it a city name. For example /weather bergen.

_ps: In one of the commits you may find a token for the bot I am using. This token is dead :)
